# SAVE-Kauri-tree
Simulation and Visualisation of Effect of Climate Change on Kauri Trees (SAVE Kauri) 

# Chosen Procedural Modeling Method
The Space Colonization Algorithm was chosen to model the trees.

A few changes to the algorithm are necessary to better suit Kauri and our purposes. Due to the non-tapering nature of mature Kauri trunks, a new function for determining branch and trunk diameter in the model is needed. Additionally, due to the importance of roots in the transmission of dieback, we wanted our model to incorporate the root systems of the trees.
